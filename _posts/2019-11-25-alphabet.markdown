Good news everyone! We have started a new project - a library of shag moves. Great opportunity for you to get inspired, check out new variations, or just boost your confidence if you dance it better.

Check it out [here](/alphabet). Let us know what you want to add. Even better, make a video and we'll gladly include it.
